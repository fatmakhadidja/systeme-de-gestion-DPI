# 🏥 Digital Patient Record Management Web App (DPI)

This web application is developed as part of the **Introduction to Software Engineering (IGL) course** at the **École Nationale Supérieure d’Informatique (ENSI - Ex. INI), Algeria**.

## 📌 Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to design and implement a **Digital Patient Record (DPI) management system**, allowing healthcare professionals to centralize and manage patient medical records efficiently. The application improves healthcare services by facilitating:  
 ✔️ Secure storage of patient medical history  
 ✔️ Easy access and retrieval of medical records  
 ✔️ Streamlined communication between medical professionals  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Frontend:** Angular (TypeScript)  
- **Backend:** Django (Python)  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **API:** RESTful architecture for interoperability  

## 🏗️ Key Features  
 🔹 **User Roles & Permissions** – Admin, Doctors, Nurses, Radiologists, and Lab Technicians with specific access levels.  
 🔹 **Patient Record Management** – Store patient details, consultations, prescriptions, medical history, and test results.  
 🔹 **Consultation & Diagnosis** – Doctors can create medical reports, issue prescriptions, and request lab tests.  
 🔹 **Medical Imaging & Lab Reports** – Integration of biological and radiological test results.  
 🔹 **Secure Access & Authentication** – User management, access control, and session handling for data privacy.  

## 📊 System Design  
The project follows a structured **object-oriented model**, including:  
 📌 **Class Diagram** – Defines entities such as Patient, Consultation, Medical Reports, and Healthcare Staff.  
 📌 **Relational Database Schema** – Ensures proper data organization and security.  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements  
- 🔸 Integration with hospital management systems (billing, HR)  
- 🔸 Mobile app for patient and doctor access  
- 🔸 AI-powered analysis for medical recommendations
